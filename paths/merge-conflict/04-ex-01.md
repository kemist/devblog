main-content: "We need to modify the resume template so it contains our information.
  Using the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), we can make
  those changes by:\n\n[![instructions for this activity](../../images/gifs/merge-conflict/username-config.gif)](../../images/gifs/merge-conflict/username-config.gif)\n\n1.
  In your imported version of the repository, checkout to the branch named: `username-config`.\n1.
  While on that branch, open the `_config.yml` file.\n1. Modify lines 12-19 with your
  information. If you would prefer to create a fictional resume, your favorite fictional
  character's information.\n1. After making the changes, create a commit, an example
  commit message might be: `Add my information`.\n\n    > If you made the changes
  on your local machine, push your changes back to repository on GitHub.\n\n1. Create
  a new pull request. Use the **base:** of `master` and the **compare:** of `username-config`.\n1.
  Although GitHub reports that you can't automatically merge these changes, you can
  still start the pull request. Click **Create pull request**.\n1. In the **This branch
  has conflicts that must be resolved** section of the pull request, click the **Resolve
  conflicts** button to resolve the merge conflict.\n1. It would appear that Skatetocat
  recently made changes to the `master` branch and modified the exact same line you
  did, this is what caused the merge conflict to occur. Click \"Resolve conflicts\",
  and remove Skatetocat's contributions to the `master` branch by deleting all of
  the content below the `=======` and above the `>>>>>>> master` content.\n\n    ![Skatetocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/skatetocat.png)\n\n1.
  We still can't mark as resolved because we need to remove the merge conflict markers.
  Delete the following lines: `<<<<<<< username-config`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>> master`.\n1.
  With the merge conflict markers removed, click **Mark as resolved**. \n1. Click
  **Commit merge**.\n1. Congratulations, you successfully resolved a merge conflict!
  Go ahead and merge the pull request.\n"
