  allows you to create native desktop applications using web technologies.\n\n<center><iframe

  allowfullscreen></iframe></center>\n\n### Environment Setup\n\nBefore we get started,
  let's identify the things you are going to need to be successful in this course.\n\n-
  Install [Git](../../github-cli/git-configuration)\n- Install [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)\n-
  Create a [GitHub account](../../intro-to-github/create-github-account)\n- Get [excited
  to learn new things](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/cheering_minions.gif)\n\nWe will
  be using Node.js packages that are not maintained by GitHub. This means that we
  chose these packages because we believe they will make the easiest, smoothest path
  to get up and running. However, as you continue to work with Electron, there may
  be other packages that are better fits for your projects.\n\n### Software Skills\n\nIf
  you are already familiar with HTML, CSS, and Javascript then adding Electron to
  your toolkit will be :cake:. For this course, the basics are more than enough.\n\n**_What
  if I'm still learning?_**\n\nDon't worry. We'll walk you through what you need to
  get today's app running, even if you don't have much experience in these technologies.\n\n**_What
  counts as familiar enough?_**\n\nCreating an app on your own requires the same level
  of proficiency that you'd need to create that app for the browser. If you are just
  getting started, here are a few free courses to consider:\n\n- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map)\n-
  [The Best Places to Learn to Code for Absolutely Free](https://learntocodewith.me/posts/code-for-free/)\n-
  [Awesome, a curated list of learning resources](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)\n\n**_What
  if I have questions?_**\n\nWe've created a repository for you! If you have any questions
  throughout this course, go here to open an issue and ask a question: [On Demand
  Electron App Repo](https://github.com/githubschool/on-demand-electron-app).\n"
